# Question

What is the danger of making API requests with API keys from the frontend? How does making an API request from the server avoid this danger?

# Answer
Using API keys directly from the frontend exposes them to potential attackers who can easily access and misuse them. To prevent this, it's better to make API requests from the server-side. This keeps API keys secure by storing them in server environment variables, making it unaccisable to users.
